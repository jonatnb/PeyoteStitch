# Peyote Pattern Maker — Delica FULL (v3.4, Locked)

**New in v3.4**
- **Reset Crop** button.
- **Lock crop to bead aspect**: your crop rectangle stays in the same ratio as bead Width:Height (so the final pattern shape matches the crop).

**Still included**
- Palette-fit (Low-Color Optimized) default — great at 10–12 colors.
- Image preview (original + live crop), draggable crop + corner handles.
- Auto width/height, Lock aspect (avoid stretch), peyote offset.
- Finished size readout, PNG/JSON/CSV export.
- Locked to `palettes/delica_full.json` (replaceable).

## Tips
- Leave **Lock aspect** ON to avoid stretching.
- For bracelets/strips, enable **Lock crop to bead aspect** so your crop matches the final pattern ratio.
